# Transposition modeling of solar irradiance

Transposition models convert solar irradiance received by a horizontal surface to that received by an arbitrary tilted surface. The inverse transposition models are used to convert irradiance from tilt to horizontal. This package gives several popular models to perform such bidirectional conversion. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This is an R package, so you need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) on your computer first. In addition, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R; it is highly recommended.

### Installing

Once R and RStudio are installed. Open R or RStudio and install the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package, which allows you to install R package from GitHub

```
install.package("devtools")
```

Load the package that you just installed

```
library("devtools")
```

Now, you can install the SolMod package, using

```
install_github(dazhiyang/SolMod)
```
